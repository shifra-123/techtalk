<!-- 
      HTML is the backbone of a web page. 
      It provides the structure and content. 
      Today, we're building a to-do list, 
      which means we'll need an input field 
      for new tasks, a button to add them, 
      and a list to display the tasks.

      In the basic structure of an HTML page, 
      the <head> contains metadata like the page's title 
      and links to CSS files, and the <body> holds the content 
      that's displayed on the webpage. 
      This structure is wrapped inside the <html> tags.
